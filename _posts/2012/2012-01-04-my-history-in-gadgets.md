As a geek, I've always been quite the gadget freak. The fact that my father was also interested in the newest toys didn't help.

A quick list of my gadgets and phones over the years:

**_PDA history_**:

**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Siena" target="_blank">Psion Siena<br /> <img src="/assets/images/2012/01/240px-Psion_Siena_512k_4f08.jpg" alt="Psion Siena" /></a>**  
This I got as a gift, from my father. Used it a lot, but outgrew it rather quickly.

**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3c" target="_blank">Psion Series 3c<br /> <img class="" title="Psion 3c" src="/assets/images/2012/01/Psion_3c_open_17o06-300x258.jpg" alt="Psion 3c" width="244" height="210" /></a>**  
I've used this device though the majority of my school years, as a note-taker, game device, development device (I actually wrote code on that thing...). Used to also have several Flash SSD's for it.

**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_m500" target="_blank">Palm m500<br /> <img title="Palm m500" src="/assets/images/2012/01/palm-m500.jpg" alt="Palm m500" height="180" /></a>**  
This PDA was the first one I bought after starting working. Used it to death. (not really, sold it)

**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5" target="_blank">Psion Series 5<br /> <img class="" title="Psion Series 5" src="/assets/images/2012/01/series51.jpeg" alt="Psion Series 5" width="350" height="210" /></a>**  
This I got from a coworker, who didn't use it anymore since it no longer charged. I replaced the batteries, and sold it on, feeling that Psion's OS no longer appealed to me.

**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten_T3#Tungsten_T3" target="_blank">Palm Tungsten T3<br /> <img class="" title="Palm Tungsten T3" src="/assets/images/2012/01/palm-t3-249x300.jpg" alt="Palm Tungsten T3" width="174" height="210" /></a>**  
As an upgrade for the m500, I got myself the T3. Quite a powerful machine for the time.

**<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_TX" target="_blank">Palm T|X<br /> <img class="" title="Palm T|X" src="/assets/images/2012/01/tx_1.png" alt="Palm T|X" width="132" height="210" /></a>**  
This was the last Palm device I owned, which I sold some years back.

**_Mobile phone history:_**

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_ga_318-99.php" target="_blank">Ericsson GA-318<br /> <img title="Ericsson GA-318" src="/assets/images/2012/01/erga318b.gif" alt="Ericsson GA-318" /></a>**  
First phone. Came with three replaceable colour covers. Sold it to a friend in the end.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_sh_888-112.php" target="_blank">Ericsson SH-888<br /> <img title="Ericsson SH-888" src="/assets/images/2012/01/ersh888b.gif" alt="Ericsson SH-888" /></a>**  
This one I stupidly forgot on a train (when I was in a rush...)

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/philips_savvy_db-151.php" target="_blank">Philips Savvy DB<br /> <img title="Philips Savvy DB" src="/assets/images/2012/01/phsavdbb.gif" alt="Philips Savvy DB" /></a>**  
This one I got from my parents as a replacement for the SH-888 I lost. Stayed with me for quite some time.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t28_world-118.php" target="_blank">Ericsson T28 World<br /> <img class="" title="Ericsson T28 World" src="/assets/images/2012/01/ert28wb.gif" alt="Ericsson T28 World" width="138" height="183" /></a>**  
My first flip-phone, which I bought after starting working. Stayed with me until the hinge system broke, causing the phone to shutdown when opening the flip.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_cmd_j70-280.php" target="_blank">Sony CMD-J70<br /> <img title="Sony CMD-J70" src="/assets/images/2012/01/soj70.gif" alt="Sony CMD-J70" /></a>**  
Bought as a replacement, but returned rather quickly (the next day), completely crappy design and non-intuitive use. The knob (command wheel) on the left was also a total fail.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_3510i-344.php" target="_blank">Nokia 3510i<br /> <img class="" title="Nokia 3510i" src="/assets/images/2012/01/no3510i_00.jpg" alt="Nokia 3510i" width="138" height="210" /></a>**  
My first foray into the Nokia world of phones. Nifty phone, worked quite nicely.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6100-368.php" target="_blank">Nokia 6100<br /> <img class="" title="Nokia 6100" src="/assets/images/2012/01/no6100_00.jpg" alt="Nokia 6100" width="128" height="210" /></a>**  
Replaced the Nokia 3510i, since I wanted something with a bit more memory (for SMS').

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_v3-853.php" target="_blank">Motorola RAZR V3<br /> <img class="" title="Motorola RAZR V3" src="/assets/images/2012/01/motorolav3_black.jpg" alt="Motorola RAZR V3" width="222" height="210" /></a>**  
The first Motorola phone I bought, which, in retrospect, wasn't a really well thought through purchase. The Motorola OS on these devices _sucks_. I still have it, the hinge sometimes fails (keyboard doesn't react), but sturdy as a rock (once dropped it three floors...).  
The only plus points for this phone are that it looks _damn_ good, and that it got me into the modding scene, as the Motorola OS was quite modifiable (flexing, anyone? :P)

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sagem_my_x3_2-631.php" target="_blank">Sagem MyX3-2<br /> <img class="" title="Sagem MyX3-2" src="/assets/images/2012/01/samyx32_00.jpg" alt="Sagem MyX3-2" width="95" height="210" /></a>**  
This phone was purchased as part of a Vodaphone.es kit, since I had gotten to know my spanish girlfriend, and using a Spanish SIM in Belgium was cheaper for her to send me SMS'.  
(it is _possibly_ the worst phone I've ever used.)

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_e65-1860.php" target="_blank">Nokia E65<br /> <img class="" title="Nokia E65" src="/assets/images/2012/01/nokia-e65-00.jpg" alt="Nokia E65" width="113" height="210" /></a>**  
_My first Smartphone_ (damn that sounds cheesy...). Still have it, use it as my work phone.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_hero-2861.php" target="_blank">HTC Hero<br /> <img class="" title="HTC Hero" src="/assets/images/2012/01/htc-hero-0.jpg" alt="HTC Hero" width="203" height="210" /></a>**  
My first foray into the Android world, as my E65 was starting to show its age. Perhaps purchased a bit too early. Got me into Android modding and flashing.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire-3077.php" target="_blank">HTC Desire<br /> <img class="" title="HTC Desire" src="/assets/images/2012/01/HTC-Desire-1.jpg" alt="HTC Desire" width="250" height="210" /></a>**  
This phone is my current phone, works wonders with the 3rd party ROMS you can find for it.

**_Tablet History:_**  
**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/asus_eee_pad_transformer_tf101-3936.php" target="_blank">Asus Eee-Pad Transformer TF101<br /> <img class="" title="Asus Eee-Pad Transformer TF101" src="/assets/images/2012/01/asus-transformer-1.jpg" alt="Asus Eee-Pad Transformer TF101" width="283" height="210" /></a>**  
The only tablet I've gotten sofar ;)
