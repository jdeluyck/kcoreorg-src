I&#8217;ve spent the last 12 days together with my lovely girlfriend&#8230; Travelled off to Spain last week on wednesday, to find her in Barajas Airport. she came together with her mum to pick me up :) Had a lovely stay at the Abba Hoteles in the Pza. de Castillia, tho the elevators are a bit noisy there :(

I went along with her to uni, followed classes (tho I understood perhaps 1/10th of it, my spanish ain&#8217;t to good yet :|, and it&#8217;s complex matter), stayed some time at her home and so&#8230; 

On friday &#8216;eve we baked cookies together, and on saturday we flew off back to Belgium together&#8230; Watch out .be, here we come :P

Saturday evening I took her to meet some friends of mine, and en groupe we went to have dinner in a local Chinese restaurant, lovely dinner :).

Sunday was a relaxed day, more or less, with my sis + friend + kiddo&#8217;s coming over to my parent&#8217;s place.. We watched some old photographs (oh, the sentiment! The memories \*snif\*) but had a nice time on the whole&#8230;

On monday we went to LiÃ¨ge, saw the Christmas market there (lovely) and walked about a bit&#8230; 

Tuesday we went to visit a friend in Maasmechelen, David&#8230; we met up at a shopping village (??!? &#8211; didn&#8217;t know that existed), and we trondled off to Maastricht, saw the Christmas market there too (boooo &#8211; crappy one) and had some drinks (after looking for half an hour to find a place to drink something, everything closes even at 6pm!!)

Wednesday was a bit quieter (stayed at home mostly), in the eve we went to Ghent, for xmas shopping, looking at the then-closed market&#8230; then went to Bruges, where the xmas-market was closed half already (only food and booze ones were still open), and back to Ghent for dinner in a veggy restaurant.

On thursday we drove all the way to Luxembourg (city, in Luxembourg country) were we met up with a Fenfen, a good friend&#8230; Had a nice time freezing and getting lost.. the old city looks nice, but everything closes too early. Guess it&#8217;s better during summer when it&#8217;s warm ;p

On friday we stayed home mostly, we baked cookies (mjummmy ;p), in the eve we went to Ghent for dinner in another veggy restaurant, and afterwards picking along &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/" target="_blank">The Incredibles</a>&#8220;, phun movie ;)

Saturday was very quiet, only a quick stop in Ghent to see the then-open christmas market, and to Bruges to get chocolates! CHOCOLATE RULES! :) :) >:) \*cough\* sowwy, got carried away. ;p

And today.. sunday.. well, we woke up, then packed her suitcase, since she has to go back home .. :( It was a very quiet day otherwise, and I drove her to the airport where she departed then at 17.25 to Madrid&#8230;

Miss you a lot, love, more then ever after this lovely time together.
