I just finished creating three new <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> Widget Plugins. Some are conversions of older plugins I made for WordPress, one is brand stinkin&#8217; new.

The initlal motivation for creating these was that Sade (my SO) wanted to use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flexo-archives-widget/" target="_blank">Flexo Archives Widget</a> to make the archives links look better. Unfortunately, the widget approach is an all-or-nothing approach: either you do it all in widget way, or you don&#8217;t do widgets at all. (yes I know, this is not 100% correct, but good enough for now). Since she used several older plugins to display information in the sidebar, this wasn&#8217;t ideal.

So I set out creating the needed widgets ;)

Some technical blabla: _Widget plugins are plugins that sit in your sidebar, and you can easily modify the order of your sidebar without having to edit the sidebar.php file that comes with your theme. Even better: if your theme supports it, the sidebar will look identical, no matter what theme you use!_

To use it, log in as administrator and go to Presentation -> Widgets.

Now, without further delay, my widgets, which you can see in action on <a href="http://sade.sadevil.org/blog/" target="_blank">Sade&#8217;s Blog</a>:

  * **Countdown Widget**: This widget will count down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until events you can set in the configuration.
  * **Projects Widget**: This widget shows project status, in percentages, and also a bar-graph. You can choose between four colours for the bargraph.
  * **Webrings Widget**: This widget will display your webrings, with the usual next/previous/random/list links. Optionally you can set a picture instead of the name.
