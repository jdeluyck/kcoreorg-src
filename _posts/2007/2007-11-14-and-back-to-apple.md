Grmble.

Yesterday I picked up my macbook, which <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/11/09/my-mac-is-back/" target="_blank">recently returned from repair</a>, and a screw fell out. wtf?

I checked, you can&#8217;t tighten it, seems the internal socket where the screw is supposed to be set in is broken/missing. Way to go Apple. You&#8217;re definitely scoring points on this one&#8230; negative points.

I took it back to the dealer, they&#8217;re going to send it back to Apple.

Fuck.
