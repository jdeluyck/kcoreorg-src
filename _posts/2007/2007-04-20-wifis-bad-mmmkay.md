In case you don&#8217;t hate <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.sco.com/">SCO</a> yet (or don&#8217;t know them), they&#8217;re a company that <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_v._IBM_Linux_lawsuit">sued IBM because they had allegedly put SCO code into the Linux kernel</a>. The whole thing still has to be proven, point, counterpoint, yadda yadda yadda. Basically they want to make everyone pay a license to them if you use linux. Old news.

Newer news: <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/5400">SCO wants to ban open WiFi networks</a>, because it would allow people to download&#8230; wait for it&#8230; omg&#8230; _porn!_

What the f<beep>k?

Firstoff: SCO, get a life.

Second: I don&#8217;t get the allmighty USA, I don&#8217;t get Americans.  
Everybody has a gun, that&#8217;s allright, fact that you can get a gun without much trouble &#8211; no fuss there. What could possibly be the trouble? Someone might think that after <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre" TARGET="_blank">the Virginia Tech shooting</a> they&#8217;ll grow a brain, but I doubt it.

But really! OMG !!11!!!!! Someone might be looking at porn! OMG! There&#8217;s a <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_mod">hack</a> that modifies <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/">a game</a> that lets you see non-nude people doing sexual movements! OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG! Call in the fire brigade! I&#8217;m amazed they haven&#8217;t decided yet to throw a nuke on every open accesspoint they see, or declare them to be <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction">WMD</a>.

Come on Americans! Wake up! Get a life!
