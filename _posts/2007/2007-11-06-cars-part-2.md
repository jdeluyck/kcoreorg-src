Continuing from <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/11/04/cars-cars-cars/" target="_blank">my previous post</a>, I've now visited a bunch of car manufacturers:  
(all cars are diesel fueled except the hybrid)

      Auris Luna Pack<br />(1.4 / 2.0)
    </td>
    
    <td>
      + Great outfit for lowish price<br />+ 5 years warranty<br />- Too narrow for two persons<br />- Finishing not really that<br />- 1.4 too weak, 2.0 too expensive
    </td>

      Prius Sol

          The car reminds me of my parent's 14-year old Mitsubishi... sturdy, and that's it. Luxury is non-existant.

Right now I'm doubting between the Kia and the Volkswagen... If the seats in the Kia hadn't made my back hurt for the remainder of a day (after a 20 min drive) it would win hands-down, but now, it doesn't...

(edit on 07/11/11: added the Prius)
