Really. What&#8217;s up with <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners these days? They buy an overpriced piece of equipment, knowing:

  * it&#8217;s SIM-locked
  * it&#8217;s a closed platform, no 3rd party apps
  * it&#8217;s SIM-locked
  * you can&#8217;t change the battery yourself
  * did I say it&#8217;s SIM-locked?
  * Apple tells them they might void their warranty when modifying the iPhone
  * it&#8217;s still SIM-locked. To AT&T.

So, looks like they&#8217;ve been warned. But they don&#8217;t care, go ahead, and after a while the necessary unlock programs were created (kudos to the <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">devteams</a> who did this, it&#8217;s a nice feat of engineering), and iPhones where unlocked, new 3rd party applications were created, the works. Nice.

Next up, Apple comes with <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/09/27/apple_iphone_update_1_1_1_offers_louder_volume_adds_itunes.html">a firmware update</a>. Tells people that <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070924-apple-firmware-update-likely-to-make-unlocked-iphones-permanently-inoperable.html">this might brick their hacked iPhones</a>. Do people heed the warning given by Apple? Nope, they flash anyway, and then loudly complain that their iPhone has become a very expensive paperweight (this can luckely and easily be remedied, it seems).

And then they want to go ahead and <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/01/iphone-users-calling-for-class-action-lawsuit-over-firmware-v1-1/">sue Apple over it</a>. Really. _Get a grip!_ You bought the piece of hardware which was locked, in more than one way, and you yourself decided to crack it wide open. Though luck than if it breaks &#8211; you get to keep all the pieces!

If you wanted to tinker with it, buy a phone with a platform that is open.

EDIT: I&#8217;ve stumbled over <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/04/if-wishes-were-iphones" target="_blank">this blog entry</a> which makes the point nicely.
