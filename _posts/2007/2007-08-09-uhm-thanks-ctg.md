I know some companies are thankful when an employee chooses to work for them (like I did &#8211; choosing to go work for CTG)&#8230; but it&#8217;s a first that the employer actually sends flowers to your home address with a thank you note :P

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="">
      <img src="/assets/images/2007/08/IMG_3562-sm.jpg" alt="Flowers as they were delivered" />
    </td>
    
    <td class="">
      <img src="/assets/images/2007/08/IMG_3563-sm.jpg" alt="Flowers put in vases" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Thanks, CTG ;) You guys (and gals) already scored good points in my book &#8211; and I don&#8217;t even actually \_work\_ there yet!
