Well,

I <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://kcore.org/2007/09/30/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">wrote</a> earlier that I was going to start with CTG, that story has gone a bit awry.

During my 2-week vacation in Spain (more about that <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/10/30/come-flush-with-us/" target="_blank">here</a>) I was contacted by <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.kbc.be">KBC</a> and they made me a proposal which I accepted. So, I'm going to work at a bank, for a bank! Scary! :p (damn, I'm going to get all mature and old....)
