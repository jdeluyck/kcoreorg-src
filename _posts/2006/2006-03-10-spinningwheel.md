Is it a plane? A bird! No! It's a spinningwheel!

Under the motto "do something else for a change", my girl and I bought a <a href="https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/92-spinning" target="_blank">Spinning wheel</a> on <a href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=8264090330&ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT" target="_blank">eBay</a>.

I assembled this 'eve to check if everything was in and everything works :) It's a weird contraption, but it's fun :) And Diana wants to learn how to spin, and who knows, maybe I'll join ;)
