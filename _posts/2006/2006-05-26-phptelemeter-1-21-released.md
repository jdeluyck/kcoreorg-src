I&#8217;ve just released phptelemeter 1.21. This release includes the following changes:

  * Extracted the common functionality between the _web parsers and moved it to a parent class
  * Removed some useless debugging code
  * Fixed bug in calculation code
  * Added skynet_web parser for Skynet

As per usual, you can download it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
