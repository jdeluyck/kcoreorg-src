On the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php" target="_blank">HTC Desire S</a>, I&#8217;ve been using an <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2031694" target="_blank">unofficial build</a> (made by <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4350964" target="_blank">Flinny</a>) of <a href="http://cyanogenmod.com/" target="_blank">CyanogenMod 10</a> for a while &#8211; happily so.  
Unfortunately the author is/was a bit strapped for time, and development slowed down significantly at the time. Updates for CM 10.1 and later were not forthcoming.  
Since I&#8217;m enough of a geek, and suffering from <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/announcements/do-you-have-obsessive-rom-updating-disorder-ord/" target="_blank">ORD</a>, I decided to try to &#8216;roll my own&#8217;: to compile CM from source. As it turned out, it&#8217;s not quite as hard as you&#8217;d think it is.

<del>First, you need to</del>I was going to write a lengthy tutorial here, but there are plenty of tutorials out there. So instead of inventing the wheel yet again, you can just go look at <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-4/general/guide-cm11-how-to-build-cyanogenmod-11-t2515305" target="_blank">this one</a>, or <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Development" target="_blank">here</a> or <a target="http://www.usoftphone.com/t115104.html" target="_blank">. Or you can just go and </a><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=building+cm+from+source" target="_blank">Google it</a> ;)

You can find the thread for <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2467013" target="_blank">my unofficial builds</a> on <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/" target="_blank">XDA Developers</a>.
