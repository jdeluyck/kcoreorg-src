An update on the <a href="https://kcore.org/2012/01/04/my-history-in-gadgets/" target="_blank">"My history in gadgets"</a> post from a while back, as things have progressed a bit meanwhile ;)

**_Mobile phone history:_**

I've since sold my Desire, and obtained/sold the following phones:

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_hd-3468.php" target="_blank">HTC Desire HD<br /> <img class="" title="HTC Desire HD" src="/assets/images/2014/05/htc-desire-hd-new-1.jpg" alt="HTC Desire HD" width="282" height="210" /></a>**  
Bought this phone secondhand, used it for a while. Quite the powerhorse for the specs, the only downside being it's weight. Was also temporarily used by my girlfriend. Sold it on in 2013.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php" target="_blank">HTC Desire S<br /> <img class="" title="HTC Desire S" src="/assets/images/2014/05/htc-desire-s-1.jpg" alt="HTC Desire S" width="258" height="210" /></a>**  
Purchased this one also secondhand for my girlfriend. After a while it returned to me and is currently in use as my work phone.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php" target="_blank">HTC One X<br /> <img class="" title="HTC One X" src="/assets/images/2014/05/htc-one-x-1.jpg" alt="HTC One X" width="261" height="210" /></a>**  
After selling the Desire HD, I got the HTC One X secondhand in 2012. This one features a quadcore Tegra3, and it's just amazing in speed and display specs. Sold it on in 2014.

**<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5-5705.php" target="_blank">LG Nexus 5<br /> <img class="" title="LG Nexus 5" src="/assets/images/2014/05/lg-google-nexus-5-1.jpg" alt="LG Nexus 5" width="206" height="210" /></a>**  
This is my current main phone.
