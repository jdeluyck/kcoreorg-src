I've always been a fan of the "stock Google" look of android, also often referred to as AOSP (<a href="https://source.android.com/" target="_blank">Android Open Source Project</a>) - a clean look, no bells and whistles added by the vendor of the device in question.  
The 'vendor' looks usually change the look of the Android OS, add (unneeded?) applications, and add their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_launchers" target="_blank">launcher</a>. There are several vendor skins, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchWiz" target="_blank">Samsung's TouchWiz</a> (<a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/New-TouchWiz-vs-old-TouchWiz-what-changed-with-Samsungs-software_id53163" target="_blank">pictures</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Sense" target="_blank">HTC's Sense</a> (<a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/HTC-Sense-6-UI-vs-Sense-5.5-UI-a-visual-walk-through-the-changes_id54257" target="_blank">pictures</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoblur" target="_blank">Motorola's MOTOBLUR</a>, and numerous others.

I just don't like them.

Don't get me wrong - they have their good things too. Usually better integration of all the vendor apps, and a higher degree of userfriendlyness.

Since my old <a href="https://kcore.org/?s=htc+hero" target="_blank">HTC Hero</a>, I've been replacing the look set by the vendor by a more stock Google Android look. So it makes only sense that my last phone should be a Google-commissioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nexus" target="_blank">Nexus</a> device, namely the <a href="http://www.lg.com" target="_blank">LG</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/5/" target="_blank">Nexus 5</a>. In black, ofcourse ;)

So, replacing the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/smartphones/htc-one-x/" target="_blank">HTC One X</a>, here's my new daily use phone:

<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5-5705.php" target="_blank"><img title="LG Nexus 5" src="/assets/images/2014/05/lg-google-nexus-5-1.jpg" alt="LG Nexus 5" height="180" /></a>

(and, before you ask, _ofcourse_ it's been rooted.)
