In 2016 I moved this blog from my own CMS over to WordPress. But seeing what a pain it actually is to keep it all updated, I decided to move to a static site generator.

This time round I went for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and I'm using [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) as a base for my theme.
There are probably here and there some things that don't work quite right just yet, but it was in a good enough shape to release on the world.

Biggest thing to get used to: [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) vs [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML). But it's a whole lot more practical ;)

I've also moved this blog from my old hosting on [Gandi.net](https://gandi.net) to an [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) setup (more on that in the future).

Welcome. Again :)
