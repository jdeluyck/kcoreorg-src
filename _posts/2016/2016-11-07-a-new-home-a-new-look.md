I finally decided to retire my custom-written CMS (wrote it back in 2003, when I had more free time), which - while obviously fantastic, super advanced, and capable of making coffee for you - had some drawbacks. Mostly being that it was a pain to use and update content with.

I also maintained a blog, on <a href="https://sadevil.org/" target="_blank">another domain</a>, which was being updated more frequently than this site.

So, to make matters easier on myself, I've merged the (old) articles with the blog and moved it to my main domain - <a href="https://kcore.org/" target="_blank">kcore.org</a>.

I also threw in a new look (which - If you're reading this on RSS - you won't notice), activated SSL (thanks to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>), and installed a boatload of redirects to keep the <a href="http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Spice_Melange" target="_blank">spice flowing</a>!

Welcome! :)
