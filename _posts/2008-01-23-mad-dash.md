Today the 100 meters mad dash started to get all the paperwork in order for my <a href="https://kcore.org/2008/01/22/i-can-haz-prius-i-can/" target="_blank">too early delivered Prius</a>.

Todo:

  * <strike>Get certificates from previous leasing firms</strike>
  * <strike>Get insurance</strike>
  * <strike>Get licenseplate</strike>
  * <strike>Get parking card</strike>

(I need the certificates to be able to get my insurance at a lower tarif)

Fun fun :p
