I&#8217;ve often wondered why people insist on letting their cars run when:

  * they&#8217;re in a shop, noone in the car
  * waiting in front of a bridge that&#8217;s up or a train crossing
  * standing still in a huge traffic jam
  * waiting in a closed (underground?) parking lot for someone/something

Don&#8217;t they get that they&#8217;re polluting like hell and wasting tons of gas? (And definitely in closed areas, it&#8217;s very unhealthy) And then people complain about gas prices, about pollution.. but doing \_anything\_ to help a bit? Naaah, too hard.

Meh, humanity. Doomed we are.
