For reasons that will soon be documented, I needed my trusty old [Targus PA-088 USB to Serial Port Adapter](http://targus.bg/product_details1ba3.html?sku=PA088E), in 
Window 10 (yeah yeah, I know...).

Unfortunately, Targus seems to have stopped supplying any drivers for this device - the most recent one on their site being from 2011. 

After some searching I came across [a long thread on Bretts Web Hacks](http://brettswebhacks.blogspot.com/2010/05/targus-where-are-your-64-bit-drivers.html), 
where I found links to drivers by other companies that use the same hardware internally. 


In the end the driver from [Magic Control Tech](https://www.mct.com.tw/download.php?lang=en&tb=1&cid=28) works fine -
just search for "Serial", or use [this direct link](https://www.mct.com.tw/include/download.php?dl=MjAxODAwNzczX158ZG93bmxvYWRefDAwMDAwMDAxMzg=)
