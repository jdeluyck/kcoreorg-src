Following up on my [Exit Synology](/2016/07/15/my-history-in-gadgets-update-2016/) post, I've decided it's time to move
from a consumer grade NAS to something a bit more sturdy. I've also been running out of memory on the Synology NAS for
the VM's I want to run on it... so.. time for something else.

Functionalities I wanted to replace:
* [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage)
* [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)
* [Container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) runtime
* VPN endpoint
* file sync alla dropbox/...
* Cloud backup
* Backup target for other devices 

I went through a few iterations before deciding on my final setup:

## First iteration: FreeNAS + bhyve hypervisor

Quoting the [FreeNAS](https://freenas.org) website: 
> FreeNAS is an operating system that can be installed on virtually any hardware platform to share data over a network.
> FreeNAS is the simplest way to create a centralized and easily accessible place for your data. 
> Use FreeNAS with ZFS to protect, store, and back up all of your data. FreeNAS is used everywhere, for the home, 
> small business, and the enterprise.

This seemed like a good solution for the NAS part of the equation. It's built on [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org), 
offers [ZFS](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/zfs.html) for storage, a bunch of [plugins](https://www.freenas.org/plugins/)
to extend the functionalities of FreeNAS beyond what the barebones offers... a bit like Synology does.

For the hypervisor part, it's less ideal.  
[bhyve](https://bhyve.org/), the FreeBSD hypervisor, isn't quite as optimized yet as many other hypervisors out there,
and [tests](https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/virtual-machine-performance-11-2-u3.76224/) 
[show](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/9vz26t/hypervisor_performance_comparison/) that there is
quite a performance penalty still - this is getting [a lot better](https://b3n.org/vmware-vs-bhyve-performance-comparison/)
in FreeBSD 12, but FreeNAS is still based on 11 (right now)

FreeNAS also has no solution for running containers except for running them in a VM.

### Second iteration: VMWare ESXi + FreeNAS VM
So, to solve the virtualisation issue, there was the halfbaked idea of running [VMWare](https://vmware.com)'s 
[ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/be/products/esxi-and-esx.html) as a hypervisor, run FreeNAS as a VM and share the storage
back to ESXi for running VM's on.

This also introduces somewhat a chicken-and-egg issue - FreeNAS needs to be started before the other VM's, and other 
VM's need to be shutdown before stopping FreeNAS. *Chaos, panic and disorder - my work is done!*

Problems:
* ESXi is a proprietary product by VMWare. The free version comes with no support, and you have no guarantee that they 
won't discontinue some hardware support. 
* ESXi needs to run on something. A USB thumbdrive works, but if you want some reliability it's advisable to use some
form of hardware RAID. ESXi doesn't do software RAID.
* For FreeNAS [PCI passthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#I/O_MMU_virtualization_(AMD-Vi_and_Intel_VT-d))
of the storage controller is required - which means I do need to have two storage controllers - one for ESXi, one for FreeNAS.
* Using NFS (or iSCSI) for ESXi datastores means that you need to run those shared filesystems in 
[sync](https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/sync-writes-or-why-is-my-esxi-nfs-so-slow-and-why-is-iscsi-faster.12506/) mode.  
Sync mode is slow (it needs to actively sync every change to disk), so you need an additional [SLOG](https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/some-insights-into-slog-zil-with-zfs-on-freenas.13633/) device.  
The SLOG device also needs to have [power loss protection](https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/list-of-ssds-with-power-loss-protection.63998/), because you *need* to be sure the writes are consistent.
* The RAM allocated to FreeNAS is 'lost' to the rest of the system.
* ESXi doesn't do containers. Running a VM with a container daemon is the only solution.

### Third iteration: Proxmox and native ZFS

From the [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) website:
> Proxmox VE is a complete open-source platform for all-inclusive enterprise virtualization that tightly integrates 
> KVM hypervisor and LXC containers, software-defined storage and networking functionality on a single platform, 
> and easily manages high availability clusters and disaster recovery tools with the built-in web management interface.

This is basically Debian, with a hypervisor shell, running on top of ZFS. It doesn't offer anything of the other things,
but it being Debian, it's not that hard to make it do all the things that I want it to do.

* NAS functionality will be done with ZFS and sharing through [Samba](https://samba.org) and [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System).  
* Hypervisor - Proxmox is basically that: a hypervisor which supports both lightweight [Linux Containers (LXC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC),
or full fledged VM's using [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page).  
* For containers there's the [docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) daemon.

I'll probably be running several containers to get the functionality that Synology offered back, like [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.org).
