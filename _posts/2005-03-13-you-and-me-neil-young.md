Open up your eyes  
See how life time flies  
Open up and let the light back in.

Open up your heart  
Let the lovin&#8217; start  
Open up and let the light back in.

I was thinking of you and me  
Makin&#8217; love beneath the tree  
And now I wonder could it be.

Thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout the times we had  
Some were good and some were bad  
Guitar fightin&#8217; the T.V.

I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me  
I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me  
I was thinkin&#8217; of you and me  
I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me.

Lookin&#8217; at you just the other night  
Dancin&#8217; in the evening light  
True love conquers all.

Old man sittin&#8217; there  
Touch of grey, but he don&#8217;t care  
When he hears his children call.

I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me  
I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me  
I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me  
I was thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout you and me.

Open up your eyes  
See how life time flies  
Open up and let the light back in.
