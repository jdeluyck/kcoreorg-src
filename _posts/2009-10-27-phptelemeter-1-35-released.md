I&#8217;ve just released <a HREF="http://phptelemeter.kcore.org/" TARGET="_blank">phptelemeter 1.35</a>. This version only has a few changes, but I wanted to get it out there:

  * Added support for Mobile Vikings
  * Added unlimited support for Dommel accounts bug report: 2886030)

As per usual, you can download it from <a HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter" TARGET="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
