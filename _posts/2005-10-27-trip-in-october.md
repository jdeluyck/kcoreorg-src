Last week I went back to Spain to visit my girl &#8211; it was an overall quiet and relaxed stay, we didn&#8217;t really do much &#8211; except making american style pancakes (thick ones) \*mjumm\* and we went to an Indian restaurant, the [Taj](http://www.restaurantetaj.com/) where we tried the Chicken Vindaloo ([Red Dwarf](http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/) anyone?).

Sad to go, but I&#8217;m going back! Wheeeeeeeeeeee! On the 8th of november!
