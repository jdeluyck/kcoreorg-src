Today is <a href="http://blogactionday.org" target="_blank">Blog Action Day</a>, to bring awareness about the environment and the problems that we (human beans_^W_beings) are causing.

I support it, but since I generally suck at writing things &#8216;on demand&#8217;, I&#8217;ll just spread the word:

<a href="http://blogactionday.org" target="_blank"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/action_250x250.jpg?w=920&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bloggers Unite - Blog Action Day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

The points that <a href="http://sade.sadevil.org/blog/?p=119" target="_blank">Sade makes</a> I support completely.
