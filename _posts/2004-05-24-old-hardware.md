Had the pleasure of installing a good old box (pentium 200 with 64mb of ram and a 2gb disk) for a friend of mine who gives them to the lesser fortunate ppl. Was actually quite fun, since I didn&#8217;t remember half of the things i should have&#8230; typical.  
Must say that obsolete operatingsystems work quite nicely on obsolete hardware ;p

On a totally unrelated sidenote, found this thing on the net today: <a href="http://www.skippyslist.com/skippylist.html" target="_blank">The 213 Things Skippy is No Longer Allowed to Do in the U.S. Army</a>. Fun!
