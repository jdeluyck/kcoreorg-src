Continuing from <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/11/04/cars-cars-cars/" target="_blank">my previous post</a>, I&#8217;ve now visited a bunch of car manufacturers:  
(all cars are diesel fueled except the hybrid)

      + Great outfit for lowish price<br />+ 5 years warranty<br />&#8211; Too narrow for two persons<br />&#8211; Finishing not really that<br />&#8211; 1.4 too weak, 2.0 too expensive

          The car reminds me of my parent&#8217;s 14-year old Mitsubishi&#8230; sturdy, and that&#8217;s it. Luxury is non-existant.

Right now I&#8217;m doubting between the Kia and the Volkswagen&#8230; If the seats in the Kia hadn&#8217;t made my back hurt for the remainder of a day (after a 20 min drive) it would win hands-down, but now, it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;

(edit on 07/11/11: added the Prius)
