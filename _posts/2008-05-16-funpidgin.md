Thanks to a <a href="http://blog.futtta.be/2008/05/16/linux-distros-en-ssh-bugs-in-beeld/" target="_blank">post</a> on <a href="http://blog.futtta.be" target="_blank">Frank Goosens&#8217; blog</a> I discovered <a href="http://funpidgin.sf.net" target="_blank">FunPidgin</a>! A fork of <a href="http://www.pidgin.im" target="_blank">Pidgin</a>, a multi-messenger client formerly known as Gaim.

My biggest (and actually, only) gripe with Pidgin is that they changed the way the contact list works/behaves &#8211; you no longer have a clear view of what protocol a user is added with, so you also don&#8217;t know what protocol to pick for someone to send him/her a message/file. Since they were obviously not going to listen to their users (although it has been requested a ton of times, search their Trac), it was only a matter of time before a fork was created: Funpidgin.

_&#8220;What makes us different from the official client, is that we work for you. Unlike the Pidgin developers, we believe the user should have the final say in what goes into the program.&#8221;_

I&#8217;m definitely gonna check it out!
