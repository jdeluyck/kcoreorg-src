<a href="http://theoatmeal.com" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a> recently had a nice post on <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla</a>, one of the greatest minds that ever lived. We owe a ton to that guy, even though he&#8217;s often not credited for it. Hell, you wouldn&#8217;t even be reading this without him.
