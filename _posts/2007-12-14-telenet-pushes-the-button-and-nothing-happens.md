<a href="http://www.telenet.be" target="_blank">Telenet</a> has launched a big campaign, known as <a href="http://www.telenetdruktopdeknop.be" target="_blank">Telenet drukt op de knop</a> (Telenet pushes the button) touting that their product line would be dramatically altered. Rumours flew around like a scrapping of the limits they impose, doubling of speeds, &#8230;

In the end, it&#8217;s basically just a big non-event: they multiplied the speed of their lowest subscription by 4, going from 256kbit to 1mbit&#8230; but keeping the ultra-low limit of 400 megabytes. Yes, that&#8217;s correct, megabytes.  
They also increased the upload speed of the other subscriptions.

So now these people will be able to get a lot faster on smallband (56kbit connection), or buy blocks to increase their limits&#8230; and increase Telenet&#8217;s revenues &#8211; ofcourse!
