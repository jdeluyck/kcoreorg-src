Yesterday I had some good old fun trying to replace the backup battery of an <a href="http://www.acer.com" target="_blank">Acer</a> <a href="" target="_blank">Travelmate 803</a> laptop. 

I thought that since this is a part that should be replaceable by the user, it should be reachable (like the memory, harddisk, you know). Guess again !

After flipping through the service manual (which I had luckily found), it seemed that there were no disassembly instructions for this battery. Looking on the blueprints of the motherboard, it showed the battery as being on the _underside_ of the motherboard &#8211; ergo, requiring full disassembly of the laptop&#8230; wtf?!?

I&#8217;m damn glad that I had the manual, because otherwise I think getting this thing apart is not quite so easy.

Here are some after-disassembly-pics:

And here, the battery&#8230;

which ofcourse had to be of another type than the five we have in the house, so now I have to wait with the reassembly until tomorrow after I get the friggin&#8217; battery! <deity>-damnit! Couldn&#8217;t they stick to the standard CR2032!?
