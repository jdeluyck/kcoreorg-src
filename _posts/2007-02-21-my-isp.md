In june 2006 I switched from the cable provider <a href="http://www.telenet.be/" target="_blank">Telenet</a> (<a href="http://www.telenet.be/nl/thuis/internet/producten/expressnet/index.page" target="_blank">Expressnet</a>) to the ADSL/hosting provider <a href="http://www.dommel.be/" target="_blank">Schedom / Dommel</a> (<a href="http://www.dommel.be/en/adsl/netconnect.php?cust=home" target="_blank">Netconnect</a>). I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve been sorry.

I left Telenet because of the not-of-this-time limits (10 gB download / 2 gB upload quota, abysmally slow &#8216;smallband&#8217; (on which you&#8217;re put after you&#8217;ve consumed your quota, unless you cough up some more &#8364; &#8211; basically, it&#8217;s so slow you can&#8217;t even get on their pages to cough up the money!), the slow innovations, etc etc. The only things going for them is the (download) speed: (theoretical) 10 mbps down, 256kbps up, and their stability: in all those years (around 7-8) I didn&#8217;t notice a lot of downtime.

When I joined Dommel, their offer was simple: 50 gB quota, you do with it what you want. 4mbps down, 256 kbps up.

Since then, they&#8217;ve introduced numerous improvements (listed per active date):

  * August 2006: increased the connection limits to the newsserver (<a href="http://www.giganews.com" target="_blank">GigaNews</a>) 
  * December 2006: upload is no longer counted
  * February 2007: 
      * boost package (higher upload speed and more quota, and higher speeds on mediumband)
      * increased newsserver retention (100 days, 99%+ retention)
  * March 2007: 
      * happy hours (only 60% of traffic is counted between 01.00 AM and 01.00 PM)
      * new traffic counter which no longer counts ATM overhead (about 11%)

Needless to say, I&#8217;m happy with their offering and can advise them to anyone in Belgium! And no, I don&#8217;t have anything to gain by this. :p
