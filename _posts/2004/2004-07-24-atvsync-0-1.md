ATV Sync is a simple script that allows you to easily synchronise the premade <a href="http://www.zaval.org/products/atv/" target="_blank" rel="external">ATV</a> <a href="http://www.zaval.org/products/atv/data/" target="_blank" rel="external">PalmOS databases</a> to your PalmOS-powered handheld.

## Usage

Put your list of channels in atvsync.conf (as they are listed on the webpage, substituting space for underscores and keeping capitalisation).  
Next, make sure your Palm is around, you're connected to the internet and run the atvsync script. This should then proceed to download the respective database files and next use pilot-xfer to transfer them to your Palm.

## Requirements

  Active internet connection (to get the database files)
