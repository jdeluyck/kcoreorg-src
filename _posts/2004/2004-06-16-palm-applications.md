Hmmm... In my quest for useless applications to put on a Palm, I've come across <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.sealiesoftware.com/pssh/">SSH2 for Palm</a> - an SSH2 client, <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://palmvnc2.free.fr/">PalmVNC</a> - a VNC client ;p and <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.smittyware.com/palm/upirc/">upIRC</a> - an IRC client.... totally pointless to have on a palm if you don't have a flatrate gprs connection or the like. ;p

I love it ;)
