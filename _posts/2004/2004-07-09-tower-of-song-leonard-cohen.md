Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey  
I ache in the places where I used to play  
And I&#8217;m crazy for love but I&#8217;m not coming on  
I&#8217;m just paying my rent every day  
Oh in the Tower of Song  
I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?  
Hank Williams hasn&#8217;t answered yet  
But I hear him coughing all night long  
A hundred floors above me  
In the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice  
I was born with the gift of a golden voice  
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond  
They tied me to this table right here  
In the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll  
I&#8217;m very sorry, baby, doesn&#8217;t look like me at all  
I&#8217;m standing by the window where the light is strong  
Ah they don&#8217;t let a woman kill you  
Not in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I&#8217;ve grown bitter but of this you may be sure  
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor  
And there&#8217;s a mighty judgement coming, but I may be wrong  
You see, you hear these funny voices  
In the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side  
I don&#8217;t know how the river got so wide  
I loved you baby, way back when  
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed  
But I feel so close to everything that we lost  
We&#8217;ll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll be back  
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track  
But you&#8217;ll be hearing from me baby, long after I&#8217;m gone  
I&#8217;ll be speaking to you sweetly  
From a window in the Tower of Song

Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey  
I ache in the places where I used to play  
And I&#8217;m crazy for love but I&#8217;m not coming on  
I&#8217;m just paying my rent every day  
Oh in the Tower of Song
