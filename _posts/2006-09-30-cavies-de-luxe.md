Seems they did like the [changes](https://kcore.org/2006/09/16/the-cavy-cage/) I made to their cage&#8230; I had to modify a bit still, because appareantely they took to pooping on one corner of the cage, where the stairs used to be. Oh well, moved to the other side, and I added some cardboardish panels to the sides of their &#8216;loft&#8217; so the hay doesn&#8217;t spill out so much anymore :)  
I also made their floor &#8216;complete&#8217; because for some reason Nero insists on smelling the bottom of the plate, and thus almost falling out (which he did once &#8211; no harm).

On weight news, the two blighters are getting big! (Check the [Cavy stats](https://kcore.org/cavy-stats/))

And on other news, with their last change, I tried some new bedding, called [NoSmell](http://sadevil.org/piwigo/picture.php/IMG_2569/category/73-our_little_critters), which is made from some weird biologic material (I think it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s left over from making linen or so), mixed with some sort of pellets. It&#8217;s got a peculiar smell, not bad. So well, I tried it &#8211; it still doesn&#8217;t smell as much as it usually does on change-day (being every 4 days), but still, it was necessary to clean it out. It does absorb better, but in the end you&#8217;re stuck with such a kind of icky disgusting thick &#8216;pasteish&#8217; like material&#8230; no thanks.

Seeing that that NoSmell crap costs about 5e for a two-times change, I think I&#8217;ll stick with [my old style bedding](http://sadevil.org/piwigo/picture.php/IMG_2570/category/73-our_little_critters) ;) (costs around 8e for 28kg!)

But, they&#8217;re two happy critters again :)
