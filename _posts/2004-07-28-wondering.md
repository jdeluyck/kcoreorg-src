I&#8217;ve often wondered if there&#8217;s a point to so many things we do, we say, we see. More than once I&#8217;ve come to conclude that many things we do are just for the masses, for the appeasing of the public that surrounds us. Looks are everything, who gives a flying fuck about the person underneath these days?

As long as you behave in a way people expect you to behave, and you are a good boy/girl, they&#8217;ll accept you. Step out of line once, they&#8217;ll be all over you like vultures, stealing what they can before dropping you like a left-over of yesterdays&#8217;s dinner.

I hate it.

New music: Celtic Requiem. Kinda sad.
