Yeah, yeah, I know, that title is about the lamest I could come up with. It&#8217;s appropriate though &#8211; since yesterday evening the main source of background noise when my pc is on is no longer my pc! I finally decided to get that noisebucket tamed, after hearing my brother-in-law&#8217;s new computer (or better, the lack of hearing it).

I replaced my old <a href="http://www.aone.co.uk/ProdInfo.ASP?ProductID=44" target="_blank">Atrix C9001-C4</a>  (<a href="/assets/images/2007/09/atrix.jpg" target="_blank">pic</a>) case (which looks cool but is not that cool, you get tired of those fancy leds VERY quickly) with an <a href="http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=15137" target="_blank">Antec Sonata III</a> (<a href="/assets/images/2007/09/sonataIII.jpg" target="_blank">pic</a>), and replacing my old <a href="/assets/images/2007/09/amd_boxed.jpg" target="_blank">boxed AMD CPU cooler </a> with a <a href="http://www.scythe-usa.com/product/cpu/030/scktn2000_detail.html" target="_blank">Scythe Katana 2</a> CPU cooler (<a href="/assets/images/2007/09/scythe_katana_2.jpg" target="_blank">pic</a>).

The difference this made to my background noise level is amazing. The noisiest things now are my harddisks&#8230; let&#8217;s go find some mufflers!
