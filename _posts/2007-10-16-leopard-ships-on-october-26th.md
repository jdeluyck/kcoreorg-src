Apple has confirmed the 26th as the releasedate for Leopard!

<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" target="_blank"><img title="Mac OS X - Arriving 26th!" src="https://kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/leopard-arriving-1026-hero-20071016.jpg" alt="Mac OS X - Arriving 26th!" width="60%" /></a>

I&#8217;ve already preordered my copy of this operating system, which has <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html" target="_blank">over 300 improvements</a>.

Now go <a href="http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/intlstoreroutingpage.html?cid=AOSA10000022132" target="_blank">order yours</a>! ;) (just kidding ;p)
