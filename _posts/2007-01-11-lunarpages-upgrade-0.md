Oi!

We&#8217;re hosted at [Lunar Pages](http://www.lunarpages.com/?id=sadevil) for our hosting, and they just announced they&#8217;re once again going to [upgrade their shared hosting packages](http://www.lunarforums.com/forum/index.php?topic=37471)&#8230; this time to a whopping 250 Gigs Storage and 2500 Gigs Transfer, and you get 10 addon-domains too ;) 

I can just say: Thank you! And keep up the good work! 

(In any case, if you hadn&#8217;t noticed: we&#8217;re quite happy with their offers and their support ;) )
