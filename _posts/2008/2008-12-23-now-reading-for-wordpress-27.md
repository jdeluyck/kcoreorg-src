After upgrading the blog to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress 2.7</a>, the <a href="http://robm.me.uk/projects/plugins/wordpress/now-reading" target="_blank">Now Reading</a> plugin didn't work very well anymore.

The developer is also kinda busy right now, and hasn't updated his plugin yet for 2.7.

No fear! Heliologue from the <a href="http://heliologue.com/" target="_blank">A Modest Construct</a> blog has <a href="http://heliologue.com/2008/12/15/now-reading-for-wordpress-27/" target="_blank">updated the plugin to work for WP2.7</a>, and work it does!
