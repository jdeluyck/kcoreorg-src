  I need some sleep.<br /> I can’t go on like this.<br /> I try counting sheep,<br /> But there’s one I always miss.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Everyone says I’m getting down too low<br /> Everyone says: "You just gotta let it go"<br /> "You just gotta let it go"<br /> I just gotta let it go
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I need some sleep<br /> time to put the old horse down<br /> I’m in too deep<br /> and the wheels keep spinning round
  </p>

    Everyone says I’m getting down too low<br /> Everyone says: "You just gotta let it go"<br /> "You just gotta let it go"<br /> I just gotta let it go

    You just gotta let it go<br /> You just gotta let it go<br /> You just gotta let it go</center>
