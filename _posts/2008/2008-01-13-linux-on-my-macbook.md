I&#8217;m currently trying to get Linux (Debian Sid) working on my MacBook&#8230; it&#8217;s installed, but still needs lots of tweaking.

Most of the things work out of the box, except the things listed below:

Specific things that work (after tweaking):

  * Xorg with resolution at 1280&#215;800
  * WiFi (atheros)
  * special buttons (volume/brightness/&#8230;)

Things that need to work still:

  * Touchpad (well, it works, but it needs to work better)
  * iSight

Sources I&#8217;m using at the moment:

  * <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/MacBook" target="_blank">http://wiki.debian.org/MacBook</a>
  * <a href="http://wikigentoo.ksiezyc.pl/Apple_Mac_Pro.htm" target="_blank">http://wikigentoo.ksiezyc.pl/Apple_Mac_Pro.htm</a>

I&#8217;ll write a detailed post on this later&#8230; when I&#8217;m not uberly lazy ;)
