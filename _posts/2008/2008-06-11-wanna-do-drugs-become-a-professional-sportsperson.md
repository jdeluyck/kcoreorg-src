I can get so goddamn annoyed at our local sport-crazy people&#8230;

The latest idiocy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Boonen" target="_blank">Tom Boonen</a>, a professional cyclist, has been caught (outside of a sports event) using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" target="_blank">cocaine</a>. Using this drug is an offence, punishable by law.

What does our wonderful country do? &#8220;Oh, my, poor guy, he probably took it because he was so lonely&#8230; bad drugs! bad drugs! good Tom! Let&#8217;s make a martyr and a hero out of him, but most of all, let&#8217;s definitly not punish him!&#8221;

WTF?!? He&#8217;s just an idiot, who 1. doesn&#8217;t do SHIT for our country (he&#8217;s been living in Monaco since 2005, so we don&#8217;t really see any tax revenue from him), does harddrugs, and now says &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; and everything is okay again?!?

His team is not gonna punish him. The government is not going to punish him. Luckely some other countries (thank you Switserland) have a bit more sense and banned him participating.

I really do hate this aspect of my country. Really really do.
