Yesterday, when walking through Ghent, we discovered a new shop specialised in coffee and tea: <a href="http://www.simonlevelt.nl/KoffieWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=3021&#038;pg=3917" target="_blank">Simon L&eacute;velt</a> on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Kleine+Vismarkt,+9000+Gent,+Gent&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=35.957999,77.431641&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16" target="_blank">Kleine Vismarkt (nr. 5) in Ghent</a>. It&#8217;s a small shop easily passed, but really worth a visit.

From their choices we took home a 250g package of &#8220;<a href="http://www.simonlevelt.nl/KoffieWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=3021&#038;pg=3917" target="_blank">Espresso Del Barista Bio</a>&#8221; (espresso of the espressomaster), and a package of <a href="http://www.simonlevelt.nl/TheeWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=2095" target="_blank">Pai Mu Tan</a>, white chinese tea. We also got a freebee: <a href="http://www.simonlevelt.nl/TheeWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=2276" target="_blank">Whitepoint mix</a>, a tea mix of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Hao_Yinzhen_tea" target="_blank">Bai Hao Yenzhen</a> tea and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong_tea" target="_blank">Oolong</a> tea.

We just had a cup of the coffee &#8211; it&#8217;s close to the best espresso we&#8217;ve had ever.
