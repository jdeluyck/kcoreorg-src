An update after my <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/02/21/my-isp/" target="_blank">previous ISP post</a>:

  * July 2007 
      * Increase of data transfer for netconnect to 75gb
  * October 2007 
      * Increase in prices :( BOOO! Well, only with a few euro's, but still... :(
  * November 2007 
      * Change in newsservice, now allowing more connections and dedicated text-news server ;)
  * December 2007 
      * Increase of data transfer for netconnect to 100gb, netconnect + boostpack to 120gb
  * January 2008 
      * Increased upload traffic in all accounts to 448kbit
      * Increased data transfer with the boostpack to 150gb
      * Increased download speed (2048kbit) on mediumband with boostpack
      * Started delivery of <a href="http://www.dommel.be/nl/adsl/adsl2.php?cust=home" target="_blank">Cityconnect</a> - a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line_2_Plus" target="_blank">ADSL2+</a> product line (available in Leuven only sofar...)

Needless to say, I'm still a very happy customer ;) But I am going to cancel my boostpack, since it no longer has use (I need the upstream speed, not the data transfer..)
