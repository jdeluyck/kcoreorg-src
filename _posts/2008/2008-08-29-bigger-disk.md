Upgraded my Macbook with a bigger disk: from an 80gb <a href="http://www.storage.toshiba.eu" target="_blank">Toshiba</a> <a href="http://www.storage.toshiba.eu/index.php?id=3&pid=192" target="_blank">MK8034GSX</a> drive (with which it came delivered) to a (secondhand) 320gb <a href="https://www.hgst.com/" target="_blank">Hitachi</a> <a href="https://www.hgst.com/sites/default/files/resources/Travelstar_5K320_DS.pdf" target="_blank">HTS543232L9A300</a> (what's in a name...). Long live diskspace! ;)

And thanks to <a href="http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> the migration was painless.
