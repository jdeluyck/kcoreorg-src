I do hate insurance companies.

Seems now the offer they made me was wrong, since I&#8217;ve driven leasing cars all my life, and so they can&#8217;t note me down as being a takeover of a contract. Hence, you end up in a more expensive scale. Oh well, It&#8217;s signed, the offer is still the best one I got.

I&#8217;ve got my temporary green card even! :D and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_plates_of_Belgium" target="_blank">license plates</a> have been requested and should be here by monday!
