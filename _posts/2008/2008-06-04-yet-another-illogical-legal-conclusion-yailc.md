In another episode of totally wonky legal battles, <a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">eBay</a> was <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieVhlM9xNEzcmDtrdw6ToFLtkRAg" target="_blank">found guilty</a> of selling counterfeit <a href="http://www.hermes.com/" target="_blank">Hermes</a> handbags by a french court.

So, let me get this straight:

  * Person A sells something on eBay that&#8217;s a fake
  * Person B buys said fake
  * Person B finds out it&#8217;s a fake, and instead of taking it up with the seller attacks the company that&#8217;s a mere falicitator of online auctions&#8230;
  * &#8230; and the french courts follow him?!??
Me no comprendo. </ul>
