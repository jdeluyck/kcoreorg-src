You know what I really hate? Crap parkers. People that have a car, and that, according to them, needs to take up atleast 1.5 parking spots. Parking so badly that you &#8211; parked nicely in between the lines, in the bloody center &#8211; can&#8217;t get in or out of your car anymore, save by crawling in the car over the seats.

Lately we&#8217;ve been encountering more and more of these idiots, so we&#8217;re starting a new category: the crap parkers.

Here&#8217;s the first (ok, not \_that\_ crap, but it was crap enough that I couldn&#8217;t get in anymore the regular way) &#8211; car on the left:
