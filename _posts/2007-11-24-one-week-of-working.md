After one week of working again, here&#8217;s a quick .. urr.. reviewish kind of thingy:

Trains suck. Really. Comon, it can&#8217;t be THAT hard to get a train to be on time for atleast the majority of time, not the other way around. I&#8217;ve taken the train 10 times this week, of which it was too late 7 times. Not what I&#8217;d call a good track record. (track record.. get it? .. nevermind)

I&#8217;m damn tired every evening. Guess I still have to get used to the working cycle again&#8230;

It&#8217;s great to have work! Yay! I have things to do that I find interesting! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :p
