I&#8217;m in the market for a car.

Why, you might ask? Because <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/10/30/work-the-neverending-story/" target="_blank">my future work</a> will no longer give me a car to use. That&#8217;s fine, the payrise covers it (and more ;) )

The questions are:

  * what car?
  * new or second hand?

Half of my friends tell me to buy a new car (even my dad told me to buy a new one &#8211; I drive accident free, so why not). The other half of my friends tell me to buy a second-hand one, since a new one is &#8216;throwing away money&#8217;. They have a point too.

And what car to buy&#8230; I was doubting for a while to go with a <a href="http://www.toyota.be" target="_blank">Toyota </a> <a href="http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/auris/index.aspx" target="_blank">Auris</a>, but the space when sitting with two is too little, it feels very cheaply built and the engine ain&#8217;t that (the 1.4 diesel, the 2.0 is too expensive). So I scrapped Toyota, and right now the <a href="http://www.vw.be" target="_blank">Volkswagen</a> <a href="http://be.volkswagen.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/be_nl/models/golf/golf_intro.html" target="_blank">Golf</a> (<a href="http://be.volkswagen.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/be_nl/models/golf/golf_intro/offres_speciales/Serie_speciale_Escape.html" target="_blank">On-Tour edition</a>) with extras. Very nice car, not cheap (unfortunately).

Tomorrow I&#8217;ll go and have a look at the <a href="http://www.kia-motors.be" target="_blank">Kia</a> <a href="http://www.kia.com/be/modellen/ceed/" target="_blank">Cee&#8217;d</a> and the <a href="http://www.honda.be" target="_blank">Honda</a> <a href="http://www.fl.honda.be/content/wagens/modellen_civic_hybrid.html" target="_blank">Civic Hybrid</a>.

So, what do you (dear reader) think?
