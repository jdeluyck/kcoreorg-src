Is it a plane? A bird! No! It&#8217;s a spinningwheel!

Under the motto &#8220;do something else for a change&#8221;, my girl and I bought a <a href="https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/92-spinning" target="_blank">Spinning wheel</a> on <a href="http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=8264090330&ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT" target="_blank">eBay</a>.

I assembled this &#8216;eve to check if everything was in and everything works :) It&#8217;s a weird contraption, but it&#8217;s fun :) And Diana wants to learn how to spin, and who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll join ;)
