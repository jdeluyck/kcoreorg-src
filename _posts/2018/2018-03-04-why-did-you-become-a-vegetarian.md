_&#8220;Why did you become a vegetarian?&#8221;_ &#8211; It&#8217;s one of those questions I get asked fairly frequently, when it comes to food choices / eating habits. I recently had the question again, at work &#8211; I&#8217;ve changed jobs recently, and it came up during a discussion. I guess it&#8217;s a good question, as not everyone has the same reasons.

(Bit of a backstory: I come from a rural home, so I&#8217;m no stranger to the &#8216;meet your meat&#8217; kind of thing &#8211; I&#8217;ve fed, petted, played, and (helped) kill animals that were bred for their meat. Can&#8217;t say I enjoyed the latter part, but it was a part of life.)

My original reasons were very.. eh..  selfish: _I&#8217;m lazy_.

As my girlfriend was living with me (at my parents house) during a sabbatical year she was taking, and combined with the odd hours I was working (two shifts), she cooked for the two of us. Already being a vegetarian, she cooked a veggy meal &#8211; but in no way opposed if I would want to cook a piece of meat. But, as I said: I&#8217;m lazy. It also opened up my palate to the wonderful world of vegetarian food, meat replacements, spices, &#8230;

After nearly a year of not eating meat, I noticed &#8211; the first time round when I got served a piece of meat &#8211; that it disagreed with me. It tasted off. The texture was wrong.  
Fast forward 10 years, and I&#8217;m now a nearly 100% vegetarian. My only vice is the once-a-year (or so) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seafood</a> pizza. I&#8217;ve stopped eating meat, poultry and fish, and cannot say that I miss it. Even more so, the smell of fried meat is something that nauseates me. Strange but true.

These last few years, I&#8217;m actually quite happy that I don&#8217;t eat meat anymore&#8230;

  * The food scandals going round (meat being sold of such quality that is way below what is allowed for consumption)
  * Horrible treatment of animals. (and I&#8217;m always cynically amused by the fact people don&#8217;t realise just how bad animals are treated)
  * Waste of water with growing all the foods required to feed the proverbial 1kg of meat. In a world where water is becoming <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42626790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scarcer and scarcer</a>
  * Pollution due to the transport of cattle all over the place (note: if you don&#8217;t watch where your vegetables come from, you&#8217;re likely just as bad of)

Will I ever become a vegan? Probably not. I&#8217;m too fond of cheese!
