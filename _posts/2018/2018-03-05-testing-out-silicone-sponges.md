I was reading some stories (don&#8217;t ask my where anymore &#8211; might have been on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a> or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lifehacker</a>) about silicone sponges to replace (the often gross) disposable sponges we used in the kitchen. Sounded like a great idea &#8211; something that you don&#8217;t need to throw away, that doesn&#8217;t become a bacterial warzone, durable.. but after trying it out I&#8217;ll be going back to the disposables.

This blog post &#8220;<a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/silicone-sponge-scrubber-review-does-it-work-243860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Tried It: Goodbye Gross Disposables, Hello Silicone Sponge</a>Â summarizes it nicely&#8230;

  * Wastes more soap/water &#8211; it just rinses off the sponge. It does the same with the bad bugs, but well&#8230;
  * Scrubbing is just a no go. No matter how much you try, it&#8217;s just not firm enough!
  * Breaks easily &#8211; the first sponge had several holes quickly enough. Might be because of the cheapo ones we got to try it out, though.
