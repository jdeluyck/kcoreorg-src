I was reading some stories (don't ask my where anymore - might have been on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a> or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lifehacker</a>) about silicone sponges to replace (the often gross) disposable sponges we used in the kitchen. Sounded like a great idea - something that you don't need to throw away, that doesn't become a bacterial warzone, durable.. but after trying it out I'll be going back to the disposables.

This blog post "<a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/silicone-sponge-scrubber-review-does-it-work-243860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Tried It: Goodbye Gross Disposables, Hello Silicone Sponge</a>Â summarizes it nicely...

  * Wastes more soap/water - it just rinses off the sponge. It does the same with the bad bugs, but well...
  * Scrubbing is just a no go. No matter how much you try, it's just not firm enough!
  * Breaks easily - the first sponge had several holes quickly enough. Might be because of the cheapo ones we got to try it out, though.
