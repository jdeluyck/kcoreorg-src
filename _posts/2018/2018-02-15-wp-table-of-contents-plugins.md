I was using the rather nice <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/table-of-contents-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Table Of Contents+</a> WordPress plugin to auto-generate tables of content on certain posts/pages, but that has since been abandoned. Luckely <a href="http://connections-pro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven A. Zahm</a> took over development, and presto, we have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-table-of-contents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Table of Contents</a> plugin. You can peruse the <a href="https://github.com/shazahm1/Easy-Table-of-Contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcecode</a> on GitHub.
