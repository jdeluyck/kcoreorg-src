It seems that visiting Germany is becoming a habit of ours during summer ;) This time we went to visit Laura, Christian and <a href="https://kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/p8191717.jpg" target="_blank">Lumi</a> (and <a href="https://kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/p8191714-me.jpg" target="_blank">Fina</a>, the cat) in Germany, last (long) weekend.

Diana and I left for Germany friday 17th, and after a rather boring 2.5 we ended up in <a href="http://www.ratingen.de/" target="_blank">Ratingen</a>. We had a room booked in the <a href="http://www.relexa-hotels.de/content/english/viewer/duesseldorf_start_5.html" target="_blank">Relexa hotel Ratingen City</a>, a nice non-expensive hotel.

(I just want to add here that I absolutely hate their parking entry/exit machines. I got a static zap from them nearly every time! \*growl\*)

After checkin, we went our way to <a href="http://www.frimmersdorf.de/index.htm" target="_blank">Frimmersdorf</a>, in <a href="http://www.grevenbroich.de" target="_blank">Grevenbroich</a>, to visit our friends. It&#8217;s a lovely town, very very green. Lumi&#8217;s a very adorable little baby, and the cat is also a fun creature :p Always hunting for flies, to the dismay of Laura and Christian ;)  
We talked a lot, had some takeaway pizza and salad, and left around midnightish.

Next day we met up with <a href="http://suse.dentatec.com" target="_blank">Gundel</a>, a knitty-friend of Diana, in <a href="http://www.duesseldorf.de/" target="_blank">Düsseldorf</a>. We went to a cute yarnshop (called Woll &#8211; Duo, in Schamhorstraße 16), where Diana bought some lovely yarn: a skein of <a href="https://kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/p8201750-me.jpg" target="_blank">Opal Neon</a>, two skeins of <a href="https://kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/p8201754-me.jpg" target="_blank">OnLine Supersock Silk</a>, and a ball of <a href="https://kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/p8201752-me.jpg" target="_blank">mystery yarn</a>.  
After that we went for a walk through the city itself, grabbed a quick lunch there (great japanese stall in the basement of a mall), headed back to the hotel, and afterwards went with our friends to the <a href="https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/21-lantern_parade_in_wevelinghoven" target="_blank">Lantern Procession</a> in <a href="http://www.wevelinghoven.de/" target="_blank">Wevelingenhoven</a>. Very cute, and very strange ;)

On sunday we first (ab)used the wellnesscentre in the hotel (which they were so nice as to open especially for us), and in the afternoon we went to the <a href="http://www.duesseldorf.de/aquazoo/" target="_blank">AquaZoo</a> in Düsseldorf. Straaaange fish. Straaaaaaaaanger bugs. But educational, and fun too ;)  
There&#8217;s a lovely park around the aquazoo too, in which we walked for quite a while before heading over to our friends&#8217; place, and having some chinese takeaway for dinner.

Monday we had to leave again for Belgium, but we did a short sidestop in <a href="http://www.die-wollfabrik.de/" target="_blank">Die Wollfabrik</a>, where Diana hoarded fiber for spinning and pretty rosewood sock knitting needles.
