Fenfen dragged us along to see some more nice viewpoints around Saarland, and [old castle]("/assets/images/2005/03/IMG_0347-me.jpg) that was preserved more or less up a hill< insert name here >. From the tower you have a very lovely view of the surroundings :) During the walk down we did some impromptu-footballing with a rock, which unfortunately had to stay behind near the bottom of the walk.

After this we went to a < insert name here > [old tower]("/assets/images/2005/03/IMG_0347-me.jpg) that&#8217;s the burial place of a few members of the Bochs family (which is way to rich), with a nice park around it. There was some strange [&#8216;modern art&#8217; thing]("/assets/images/2005/03/IMG_0348-me.jpg) there too that was supposed to depict nature or something. I didn&#8217;t really get it ;p

After this we went to < yet another place > with some vantage viewpoints where you can see the [&#8216;loophole&#8217;]("/assets/images/2005/03/IMG_0355-me.jpg) in the river Saar.

In the end we took off for Belgium once again, standing in some traffic jams, and having fun with a bus full of kiddies trying to catch the attention of the drivers, until one point Diana stuck out her tongue and they were mostly amazed ;p

For dinner we went to a little place called K-roes-L, where we had big buckwheat pancackes filled with goat cheese and tomatoes&#8230;. toooo goood and tooooo much ;)  
After dinner we went to see [Robots](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358082/), which is a really funny movie to see ;p
