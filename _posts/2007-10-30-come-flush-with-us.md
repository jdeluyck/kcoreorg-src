**_&#8230; or the story of our two-week vacation in Madrid. _**

So, in between the jobs we thought it&#8217;d be nice for me (Jan) to go to Madrid for a two-week stay. We looked online, found a nice place with <a href="http://www.rent4days.com/" target="_blank">Rent4Days</a>: a <a href="http://www.rent4days.com/ficha.asp?ciudad=Madrid&idioma=English&mkt=sinmkt&origen=AllApartments&piso=Loft+Ciudad+Lineal+2" target="_blank">loft</a> located close to <a href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&hl=es&q=Ciudad+Lineal,+Espa%C3%B1a&sll=40.396764,-3.713379&sspn=12.424862,28.278809&ie=UTF8&oi=georefine&ct=clnk&cd=1&geocode=0,40.437845,-3.638140" target="_blank">Ciudad Lineal</a>, some metro stops, in short: nearly ideal. The pics on the site also make you believe it&#8217;s lovely. It would also be overlooking a park, which is great &#8211; nature always is very relaxing. It also says it sleeps 7, so it&#8217;s gotta be big. Nice!

Diana did some initial shopping the day before, and on the first day we headed over to the place. We were a bit dissapointed, since it was actually more of a store that had been &#8216;reformed&#8217; into an appartment. (reformed being a key word here). Oh, and it wasn&#8217;t really overlooking a park either &#8211; you had to get outside, walk a block, and then there&#8217;s the park. Ah well, as long as it&#8217;s nice, quiet, cosy&#8230;

Boy, were we wrong about this one.

Here&#8217;s a list of problems with the thing:

Overall problems:

  1. The place is \_cold\_. Both physically cold, and not cosy at all. It lacks furniture, posters, &#8230; anything on the bare walls to make it cosy. We had to put on the heating, while it was 25ºC outside.
  2. _You get to enjoy the sounds of your neighbours peeing, taking a shower,&#8230; since every time they flush, or do anything with water, it sounds as if the ceiling is going to collapse. Not fun._
  3. Light. I like light by day. I hate it by night. The curtains (if you can call those pieces of fabric curtains) that were there were utter, total, complete, mega crap. They let through 99,9% of the light.  
    They weren&#8217;t even long enoug! The bottom part was hung from the curtains using pins&#8230; (not even sewn on)
  4. Noise. NOISE. **NOISE!** You hear everything, the smallest movement someone makes in the other appartments, you&#8217;re part of it, you can follow it, it&#8217;s all yours!

Bathroom problems:

  1. The bathroom has a leak, from the upstairs neighbours. We reported this, no one came to look or even bothered to call us back.
  2. The <a href="/assets/images/2007/10/pa211879.jpg" target="_blank">shower</a> is useless &#8211; it&#8217;s got a 5cm deep basin, and the drain is crap, so if you shower, you flood the bathroom.
  3. Again on the shower, don&#8217;t use it. It will break. We had to buy a new shower tube because it broke, and we didn&#8217;t want to cough up 50e or more (standard fee by Rent4Days, it costs maybe 8e if you buy it in a shop)

Kitchen problems:

  1. If you dare use the washing machine (good luck without the instructions), and spin stuff, don&#8217;t be amazed when <a href="/assets/images/2007/10/pa211877.jpg" target="_blank">the kitchen cabinet falls apart</a>.
  2. The sink is placed in a way that you can never stand completely behind it, unless you&#8217;re a plank. Wonderful.
  3. There are no cabinets. Don&#8217;t even think of storing anything &#8211; there is NO room.
  4. This place is supposed to sleep 7, but forget about eating or drinking with 7. Not enough dishes/glasses/cutlery! You can even forget about cooking for seven! The biggest pot is about 3l.

Bedroom:

  1. This is supposed to be a <a href="/assets/images/2007/10/pa211878.jpg" target="_blank">double bed</a>. It is 120cm wide, the width of a double bed about 30 years ago. Good luck trying to sleep in that with 2 people.

So after about 6 sleepless nights, we moved back into Diana&#8217;s place (which is tiny and with four definitely over-populated), and called the people of Rent4Days to explain the situation, and to tell them that their offer was below anything possible. What did they tell us? &#8220;You are the first persons to complain&#8221;. On the remark that this place does not overlook a park, they said &#8220;We know the area, it overlooks a park.&#8221; Sorry, it overlooks a GARAGE. Not a park. Not even remotely.

We <a href="https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/29-madrid_october_2007" target="_blank">took some pics</a> so you can compare them with the things on their site.

**So really, if you&#8217;re looking for something &#8211; stay away from Rent4Days. They&#8217;re crap. Expensive service that offers cheap crap.**

To make a long story short, the rest of the days we spent at Diana&#8217;s place, and we didn&#8217;t really do much. The six sleepless nights were enough to drain our energy.

We did <a href="/assets/images/2007/10/pa211886-me.jpg" target="_blank">throw a party</a> there, for our friends &#8211; even though it wasn&#8217;t allowed. Sorry, but after all this they deserve a very big _screw you_. It was fun, we played Killer Bunnies (having to explain everything to Diana and then she had to translate it into spanish&#8230; what a mess \*g\*). We had loads of food, brought by our friends and cooked by us, we also had booze! (sangria and sweet wine), and since it was the last Formula 1 sunday, the tv was on. It was great fun.
