I was bored recently, and decided to install Linux on my Macbook. I opted for the distribution I like best - <a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_blank">Debian</a> (<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/" target="_blank">unstable/Sid</a>).

After some twiddling it all works rather well, I'm amazed how well ;) Even suspend to ram works flawlessly! (that was a different case a year ago, when I last had linux on a laptop). The only things I still have to get working is the framebuffer console (so I get something better than 80x25), and the infrared. Nothing very high on the agenda, though :)

I've detailed the installation instructionsÂ <a href="https://kcore.org/2010/05/02/running-linux-on-an-apple-macbook-21/" target="_blank">in this post</a>.
