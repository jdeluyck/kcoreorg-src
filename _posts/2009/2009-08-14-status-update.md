Short summary of what I&#8217;ve been busy with:

  * We&#8217;ve moved to a new place, near the city of Ghent. Lots of painting needed be done, decoration, stuff like that&#8230; kept me busy for the better part of two months. The results are viewable <a href="https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/116-appartment_we_re_renting" target="_blank">here</a>.
  * We&#8217;ve also moved internet providers, since the all-in-one bundles (TV+Telephony+Internet) came out cheaper in the end. So I&#8217;m back at <a href="http://www.telenet.be" target="_blank">Telenet</a>.
  * Friend from Spain came over during the <a href="http://www.gentsefeesten.be/" target="_blank">Gentse Feesten</a>. It&#8217;s a treat being able to go by bus to the centre of Ghent in 10ish minutes ;)
  * On a sadder note, one of our <a href="https://kcore.org/category/cavies/" target="_blank">smoothcoat cavies</a>, <a href="https://kcore.org/2009/07/20/in-memoriam/" target="_blank">Macchiatto</a>, passed away on july 20th.
  * I&#8217;ve managed to trash the linux installation on my macbook, and since I too lazy I put Mac OS X on it again. Said macbook also had to go in for repairs anyway (crack in the topcase). All fixed now, free of charge.

I think that&#8217;s about it. Mostly getting settled now in the new place&#8230; so far so good ;)
