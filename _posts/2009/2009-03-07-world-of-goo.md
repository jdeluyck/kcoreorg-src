A good friend of mine introduced me to a new game: <a href="http://www.worldofgoo.com" target="_blank">World Of Goo!</a>

I've finished the demo, and it's damned addictive ;)

There are <a href="http://worldofgoo.no.sapo.pt/" target="_blank">user levels</a> available too, so the gameplay isn't limited to the game itself ;)

And, as a nice bonus: It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux!
