Another black day for the world: G. W. Bush won the 2004 elections. Great. Fantastic! Now we&#8217;re atleast sure that the US will be hated even more throughout the world than it already is&#8230; Wonder what stupid decisions he&#8217;ll make this time. Perhaps rule that the US is the only power in the world that should be allowed nuclear weapons, and that every country that doesn&#8217;t do it&#8217;s bidding must be attacked preemptively to hunt down non-existing terrorists?

What a load of cr*p.
