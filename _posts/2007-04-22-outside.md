Today I put them little critters outside for a change, in an old cage we have standing around. It was obvious that they had a bit of a hard time adjusting to all the noises that are there and as such they were hiding a lot&#8230;

<table CLASS="" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="center">
  <tr>
    <td CLASS="" WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center">
      <img SRC="https://i0.wp.com/kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_3216-sm.jpg?w=920&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />
    </td>
    
    <td CLASS="" WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="center">
      <img SRC="https://i0.wp.com/kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_3218-sm.jpg?w=920&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td COLSPAN="2" CLASS="" ALIGN="center" COLSPAN="2">
      <img SRC="https://i0.wp.com/kcore.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/IMG_3217-sm.jpg?w=920&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

But &#8211; again next weekend! So they can get used to it! :) But I&#8217;ll get a bigger cage, so they have more space to hop around.
