Once again, Belgium is the laughing stock of the EU.

Once again, we&#8217;re without a government, due to their <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/12/19/belgium.government.resignation/index.html#cnnSTCText" target="_blank">own inability to follow the constitutional division between the powers in the country</a> (justice/political).

Great.

Politicians: pay back the wages you&#8217;ve been (over)payed, and go home. It really is time to put some people at the wheel that know what they&#8217;re doing, because obviously the ones we had up to now are le crap.
