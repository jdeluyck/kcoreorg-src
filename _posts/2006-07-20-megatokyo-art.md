One of my favourite web comics, <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MegaTokyo</a>, published a really very beautiful DPD (Dead Piro Day, a &#8216;filler&#8217; image that&#8217;s used when there&#8217;s no real episode) of Miho, one of the characters of the Story.

Stunningly beautiful. Drawn by Fred, Coloured by Hawk (from Applegeeks (another web comic))
