In short, I finally found a way to manipulate windows under Mac OS X like you can in X11:

  * ALT+left mouse button: move window around
  * ALT+right mouse button: resize window

Well, <a href="http://developers-club.com/posts/59968/" target="_blank">NuclearMouse</a> (a <a href="http://culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php" target="_blank">SIMBL</a> plugin) makes it happen!
