Yesterday I went to <a href="http://www.fem.be/" target="_blank">FEM Computer Systems</a> in Aalst, Belgium &#8211; a local computer store that sells PC&#8217;s and Apple stuff. After my [wonderful time](https://kcore.org/2007/03/14/switch-no-thanks/) in another store, I was kinda weary, but for nothing :) The service is great, they treat people like they should be treated :)

So, after half an hour, I walked out with a paper with the following lines (of an order) on it:

> <table border="0">
>   <tr>
>     <th>
>       Item
>     </th>
>     
>     <th>
>       #
>     </th>
>   </tr>
>   
>   <tr>
>     <td>
>       MACBOOK DC2/2.00/SD/QWNL APPLE
>     </td>
>     
>     <td align="right">
>       1.00
>     </td>
>   </tr>
>   
>   <tr>
>     <td>
>       MEMORY 1024MB IMACINTEL 1.8/2.0 KINGSTON
>     </td>
>     
>     <td align="right">
>       2.00
>     </td>
>   </tr>
>   
>   <tr>
>     <td width="100%">
>       MEMORY 512MB IMACINTEL 1.8/2.0 KINGSTON
>     </td>
>     
>     <td align="right" nowrap>
>       -2.00
>     </td>
>   </tr>
> </table>

And today, around 11:50, they called to let me know that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html" target="_blank">the machine</a> is ready! Wheeeeeeeeeee! And VERY fast!  
Too bad that I&#8217;ve got to work until 19:00 today, and the shop closes at 18:00&#8230; so well, picking it up tomorrow :D
