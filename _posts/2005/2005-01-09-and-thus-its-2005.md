Well, what can I say? Best of wishes to everyone for 2005, and hopefully less violence/war/stupidity/suffering in the world.. Tho we really didn&#8217;t start of well, with the disaster that happened (and the medical disaster that&#8217;s starting to happen now) in the middle east with the Tsunami.. I hope that solutions are worked out quickly to make sure the needs get resolved&#8230;

On a more personal note, I spent last newyears with my lovely girlfriend for the first time, was one of the best ones sofar :) but as usual, it&#8217;s a pain to have to watch her go away again after spending a week together&#8230;

Next time I&#8217;ll be seeing her will be in february, on the 18th, with her exams and all&#8230;

We spent the week mostly at home, enjoying eachothers company and doing &#8216;normal couple stuff&#8217;, like groceries, watching a movie, &#8230; We went to a verry nice greek restaurant too, called Zorba, with live music and very attentive waiters.. A real treat ;)

Otherwise the period has been very calm&#8230;
