Last thursday, the 30th of June to be precise, Diana landed back in belgium :) After going through hell traffic we got home, spent a quiet evening there. We watched [The Tuxedo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290095/)) and went to sleep.

Friday the 1st, our anniversary day :p we moved out to Ghent for some relaxing days in the [Ghent River Hotel](http://www.ghent-river-hotel.be/), a nice &#8216;old-style-ish&#8217; hotel near the River in Ghent (as you probably would have guessed by the name ;p). We did some impromptu walking about in the city, and then moved off to Brussels to go to the vegeterian restaurant [L&#8217;Element Terre](http://www.resto.com/lelementterre/), one of the really cute _real vegetarian restaurants_ in Belgium. We got lost going there tho, driving off on the wrong side on the ring around Brussels.. \*shame\* but we got there in the end.

On saturday we got out of bed late, had a small meal (Diana had poffertjes! and I had an omelette), and we went to [Wellnesscentre Bijtebier](http://www.bijtebier.be/) in Drongen, where we spent a lovely 4 hours in different sauna&#8217;s, turkish steambath, swimming pool, jacuzzi, bubblebath, and a good backmassage too :)  
Totally relaxed we went to the veggy eathouse Panda in Ghent, and afterwards met up with Chris and his girlfriend for [Sin City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/), a weird black/white/red/yellow movie ;p take your pick of the color you like best ;p  
Afterwards we went for a drink on the Friday market, where we basically closed the only &#8216;decent&#8217; pub that was still open (djeez, everything closed at 1am&#8230;), going to bed around 3am.

Sunday &#8216;morning&#8217; (more around noon) we left the hotel and went for pasta brunch on the friday market (goooood paaaasta ;p too much tho). We walked about a bit in the city and then went home to felicitate my sister for her birthday, and hand over presents.. and eat pancakes! Mjummy mjummy pancakes ;p and lots of them \*g\*  
In the evening we went to [Pinocchio](http://www.resto.be/ware/details.jsp?businessid=4725), a true traditional Italian pizzeria, with veeery good handmade pizza&#8217;s (watch the chef while you wait), good wine, deliceous desserts.. \*daydreaming\* that was so good :)  
Afterwards, trip back to the hotel and a relaxing night :)

On monday we signed out of the hotel, stuffed our stuff in the car, went home, and had a quiet day really. We went out to Aalst to buy some fresh veggies and other assorted stuff, and Diana cooked a great dinner at home :)  
We did get some rather bad burns from _ze evil polenta_, but well, one&#8217;s gotta pay for good food&#8230;

Tuesday I had to go to work, and after getting home we walked around the rustique environment of Erembodegem (looking at the house-styles too, some ppl make weiiiiird buildings). We watched part of [Princess Mononoke](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/), a sort of classic anime, and went to sleep.

Wednesday we went first to my work&#8217;s offices in Capelle aan de Ijssel in the Netherlands to pick up a shipment, and went through to Rotterdam. Damn weird city, weird streets and too many roadsigns! We did some impromptu shopping at Albert Hein, went home and Diana cooked a lovely dinner for us both (I did help a little bit ;p)

On thursday I had to work again, and in the eve we went off to the cinema to go watch [Madagascar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/)! Great &#8216;kiddy&#8217; movie! I like to move-it move-it!

Friday we met up with Kim (a good friend) in Ghent, and went to the [Quetzal Chocolate-bar](http://www.chocoladebar.be/) in Ghent and had a veeery good Chocolate fondue there. After that we walked around Ghent a bit more (shopping streets!), bought some general stuff (including a Belgian mobile + prepaid card for Diana ;p), had an icecream and went home again.

On saturday we had a big family meeting, lots of people (14 in total!), with cake, cheese, bread, &#8230; which basically took nearly all day.

And finally on sunday Diana had to go home again.. It&#8217;s been short, yet felt long, but too short all the time. Sad to see her go again.. but she&#8217;s back in August :D :D
