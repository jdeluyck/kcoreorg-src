This fine day we went with Fenfen to [Saarlouis](http://www.saarlouis.de/), his hometown, a small quiet town next to SaarbrÃ¼cken. First we went to see the [Teufelsburg](http://www.dersaargau.de/teufelsburg.htm), which translates to &#8220;The Devil&#8217;s Castle&#8221;. There are some midieval organisations that use this as a place for their campments or to perform acts, which can be found [here](http://www.teufelsburg1.de/). Afterwards we went into the city itself for a quick dinner, and moved on because Fenfen needed to get ready for his role in the [Passionplay of Christ](http://www.saarlouis.de/freizeit_tourismus/2705.php) ([pics](https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/14-saarland)), during which he was flogged (tho only with woolen floggers &#8211; booooooooooo! We want our money back! ;p) and then crucified, tho as you can see on the pics he didn&#8217;t really die of it ;p

A pity it was all in german, so I got only little of it, but it was fun ;)

Afterwards we went along with the crew for a drink and a piece of (coldish) pizza, and in the eve we (once again) opted for dinner at the Pizza Hut, a veggy salad this time tho.
