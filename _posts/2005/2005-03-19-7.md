After picking Diana up from the airport, we went to [Ikea](http://www.ikea.be) in Zaventem to pick up some stuff we&#8217;d need for home still (living with two requires organizing). After that we went to Brussels (you know, capital city of our pocketsized country called Belgium ;p) which unfortunately was crowded due to a general strike by the labour unions with the oncoming TOP-meeting of the EU in brussels. I must say it seemed more like a carnaval fair than a protestmarch, with the drinking stands and a live concert, but I guess that&#8217;s just me. 

A quick stop at FNAC&#8217;s for a book ([Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com)&#8216;s [Belgium & Luxembourgh](http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/product_detail.cfm?productID=2551) travel guide. Full of handy tips and everything ;) We also made some little shopping at Ikea for some stuff I still needed to take over Jan&#8217;s room :D

We had a quiet eve otherwise, spent some time unpacking, and then we had dinner at a lovely spicy Thai restaurant called Bankok city. Damn hot food! Very sweet in the beginning, but how it burnt in the end&#8230; My tongue went numb :~
