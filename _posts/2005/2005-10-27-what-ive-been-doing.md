What have I been doing the last times... well...

1. I flashed my Moto phone with the latest _stable_ firmware, and it still works, and I've got video recording and more speed and a searchable addressbook and .. and.. Well, you know - flashing it made me sweat beyond belief (like OMG is it going to work? or not? \*panic\*)

2. I bought some <a href="http://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank">RedHat</a> books for <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/" target="_blank">Enterprise Linux 3</a> and maybe getting the certificates for RHCT and RHCE.. and whatever. I'll see - studying time.

3. I changed the blogging software we use on the <a href="http://www.sadevil.org/" target="_blank">sadevil.org</a> website (which is the site of Diana and me) from <a href="http://www.bigevilbrain.com/sphpblog/" target="_blank">sphpblog</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, which seems to be a bit more maintained. We decided to move after Diana's sphpblog got hacked, and well.. her new blog is now up at <a href="http://sade.sadevil.org/blog" target="_blank">http://sade.sadevil.org/blog</a> and her site is now at <a href="http://sade.sadevil.org" target="_blank">http://sade.sadevil.org</a> :P (and yes it looks great :)  
I've also 'modded' an existing plugin for WordPress and made a sphpblog to WP convertor: you can find those below.

4. I've gone back to Spain on the meanwhile too, but for that you'd better see [our blog](http://www.sadevil.org/blog/). Not gonna repeat that here. I'm WAY too lazy :p

5. I've gotten my girl her birthday present, _it_ looks nice :p and I'll say later what _it_ is because she also reads this blog \*g\* :P

6. I nearly finished painting my new livingroom! Just need to throw out a bunch of crap more and paint the place that's used by that crap, but that'll hopefully be done in two-three weeks.. I have 12h-shifts the whole week next week, and no time in the weekends, and then going back to spain for a week, and then... well... we'll see :p

That's about it!
