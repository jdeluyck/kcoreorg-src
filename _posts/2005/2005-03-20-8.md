Today we went to Battice - Vervies, to a whiskey festival, where the [pipeband](https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/15-battice_whiskey_festival) I play in played several times. It was okay, prolly more fun if you're a fan of whiskey ;p which, for the record, I'm not really. After a tiring day we went back home again, and had a quiet eventing at home. Nothing much, really.
