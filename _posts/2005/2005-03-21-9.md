Today after my work (waaaaay to early to get up.. \*snif\*) [we went to](https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/16-mini_europe) act like little children in [Mini Europe](http://www.minieurope.com/), a place with tons of scale models of great sights (and sometimes sounds!) of the European countries. Unfortunately several models weren't finished yet when we went there, but that's okay. After spending more than an hour in that place (ooh! A button! \*push\* \*bark! bark bark!\*) we walked about the [Brupark](http://www.bruparck.com/) where you can find some little shops but mostly eating/drinking places. We opted for eating at a chinese there called [Asia City](http://www.bruparck.com/village_nl.asp#perma) - friendly staff, food was good. Afterwards we picked along the movie [Constantine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/) and went home.
