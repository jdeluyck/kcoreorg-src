We went to see the city of [Ostend](https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/13-ostend) today, which is one of the coastal cities of Belgium. We had some bad weather for starters, but it cleared out pretty quickly. And most of all: it was \_quiet\_. ;) We walked along the coastal line for some km, enjoying the sounds of the sea and the refreshing winds ;)

We had a coffee and pancakes at the pub ['Au Penguin'](/assets/images/2005/03/IMG_0277-me.jpg). Very mjummy pancakes, and loose tea :~ and the glasses for Fanta were really original! (damn, forgot to take a pic of them, sowwy). Bought a good map too (for the trip to Germany).

Afterwards we went home and spent a quiet evening there watching a part of [Jabberwocky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076221/), a crazy movie of the Monthy Python crew. Okay, we fell asleep halfway ;p so we didn't see it completely :)
