I've started a new project, a php based 'meter reader', for Telenet, to be able to get the usage statistics in an easy way instead of having to log into their site all the time...

The releases will be posted on SourceForge, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter/files/phptelemeter/" target="_blank">here</a>.

There's a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/phptelemeter/code/ci/master/tree/README" target="_blank">README too</a>!

You can find the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/phptelemeter/code/ci/master/tree/ChangeLog" target="_blank">Changelog here</a>.
