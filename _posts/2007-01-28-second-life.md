After all the hipe that&#8217;s being created around the virtual online game <a href="http://www.secondlife.com" target="_Blank">Second Life</a>, I decided to give it a quick spin. Quick being very quick here, since after around 30 minutes I bailed out and deleted the game. 

The interface is rather unintuitive, and the graphics aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call up to spec with the current grade of MMORPG&#8217;s. It&#8217;s probably me :p

I&#8217;ll stick with Guildwars and the like ;)
