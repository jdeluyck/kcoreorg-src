Today I went for <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/11/12/test-drive-with-toyota-prius/" target="_blank">another testdrive</a> with the <a href="http://www.toyota.be/" target="_blank">Toyota</a> <a href="http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/prius/index.aspx" target="_blank">Prius</a>, longer this time &#8211; 2 hours &#8211; to see how the car handled in all the usual traffic, and also to be able to judge the seats, the radio, the cruise control, the multi-info-display, everything.

My judgement: it drives great, the seats are very comfy, and it&#8217;s oh.. so.. quiet ;) The fuel economy for my trip of 130km was 4.7/100km, which isn&#8217;t bad at all &#8211; not having driven a Prius this long before, and not taking special measures to limit gas usage.

So, in the end, I finally comitted, and ordered a <a href="http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/prius/color.aspx" target="_blank">Red</a> Toyota Prius!
