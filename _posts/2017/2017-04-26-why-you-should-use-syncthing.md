I've been a user of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a> for ages, I've tried <a href="https://owncloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Owncloud</a>, I've tried <a href="https://www.box.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Box</a>, and probably numerous others that I've forgotten about, but in the past year I've migrated over to <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syncthing</a>, and I haven't looked back. Opensource software, well designed protocol, complete ownership of your data, I could go on... but this post by <a href="https://linuxctl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gbolo</a> explains it perfectly!
