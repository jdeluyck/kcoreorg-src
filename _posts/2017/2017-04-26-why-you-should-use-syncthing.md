I&#8217;ve been a user of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a> for ages, I&#8217;ve tried <a href="https://owncloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Owncloud</a>, I&#8217;ve tried <a href="https://www.box.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Box</a>, and probably numerous others that I&#8217;ve forgotten about, but in the past year I&#8217;ve migrated over to <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syncthing</a>, and I haven&#8217;t looked back. Opensource software, well designed protocol, complete ownership of your data, I could go on&#8230; but this post by <a href="https://linuxctl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gbolo</a> explains it perfectly!
