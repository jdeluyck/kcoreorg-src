As some of you might already know, last friday was my last day of work for <a href="http://www.triennium.com/" target="_blank">Tri-enniuM</a> (and ergo, <a href="http://www.reuters.com" target="_blank">Reuters</a> and <a href="http://www.kbc.be" target="_blank">KBC</a>). I went to say goodbye at our head-office in Rotterdam on the 25th, gave a farewell drink for the collegues at KBC on the 26th, and finally left the company on the 28th. It&#8217;s still somewhat strange, being that this was my first job after leaving school. Oh well, we move on in life&#8230;

During my farewell drink I was pleasently surprised by Reuters: they gave me a bag of Reuters goodies (yeah, yeah, I can hear you people already, but they&#8217;re nice and I appreciate the gesture and they&#8217;ll come in handy!)

From the people of the bank, I got a gift certificate for <a href="http://www.mediamarkt.be/" target="_blank">Media Markt</a>&#8230; very bad for my own wallet too :p

It&#8217;s a bit sad to think that my own company didn&#8217;t bother to give anything &#8211; I hadn&#8217;t expected it, but while the people that I only worked with &#8211; not for &#8211; bothered, it highlights one of the reasons why I decided to leave: lack of any kind of caring for your employees. For those that are wondering: the other reasons I decided to change jobs is the lack of actual work and diversity in it. Oh, and also the fact that they still don&#8217;t get the Belgian legislation right&#8230;

Enough about the past! The future is bright, it&#8217;s CTG ;) (but only starting 2nd of november, I&#8217;m <a href="https://kcore.org/2007/08/01/change-of-work/" target="_blank">taking a month off</a> in between)
