This fateful day we met up with an old friend of mine (actually, ex-gf \*panic\*) in Ghent, were we had lunch at a cute little bar, then walked over to a deliceous Chocolate Bar (mjummy choco milkshakes&#8230; \*melt\*). And the two girls had lots of fun (I wonder what they&#8217;re planning against me&#8230; \*runs away in terror\* \*g\*)

In the eve we ate ate the [Faim Fatale](http://faim-fatale.be/) restaurant (came recommended in the Belgium Guide); a small but inventive eating place where we had &#8220;Open Lasagna&#8221;, which is basically a lasagna but not &#8216;prepared&#8217; in layers as per usual, but more like two layers of pasta with all the ingredients in between. Very mjummy!

For dessert Diana had a Chocolate Mousse (which was close to &#8211; if not \_the\_ best chocomousse I&#8217;ve ever tasted&#8230; so succulent and melting and &#8230;mmmmmmmmmm&#8230;..), I had a Dame Blanche (which is vanilla icecream with hot molten chocolate)
