My name is Jan De Luyck, currently inhabiting a small town near <a href="http://www.lochristi.be/" target="_blank">Lochristi</a>. I&#8217;m happily living together with my partner, Diana.

I&#8217;ve studied <a href="https://www.hogent.be/toekomstige-student/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/" target="_blank">Applied Computer Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.hogent.be" target="_blank">Hogeschool Gent</a>, and as such, I&#8217;m pretty much a technical-minded person. I&#8217;m mostly busy dealing with technology &#8211; be it at home, on Linux, Android, related to some hardware projects, software, or at work.

In 2001, after graduating, I went to work for Tri-enniuM (now known as <a href="http://rivium.nl/nl/" target="_blank">Rivium</a>), as a consultant for Reuters real-time trading environments. I&#8217;ve since moved on, and now work for <a href="https://www.kbc.com/en" target="_blank">KBC</a>, as a systems engineer &#8211; busy with the architecture of our Linux / Unix platforms, and providing 3<sup>rd</sup> level support for our in-house customers.

In my spare time I&#8217;m also a singer (tenor) at <a href="http://artemusicale.be/ensembles/kamerkoor-furiant/" target="_blank">Kamerkoor Furiant</a>Â in Ghent, a bagpipe player at the <a href="http://www.fcpd.be/" target="_blank">Flemish Caledonian Pipes & Drums &#8220;Clan MacKenzie&#8221;</a>, an avid pen-and-paper role-player and a fan of boardgames :)
